# Defin function 2 convert from one currency 2 another
def convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency):
  # Get the current exchange rate for the 2 currencies
  exchange_rate = get_exchange_rate(from_currency, to_currency)

  # Calculate the converted amount
  converted_amount = amount * exchange_rate

  # Return the converted amount
  return converted_amount

# Define a function to get the current exchange rate between two currencies
def get_exchange_rate(from_currency, to_currency):
  # Connect to the currency exchange rate API
  exchange_rate_api = connect_to_exchange_rate_api()

  # Query the API to get the current exchange rate
  exchange_rate = exchange_rate_api.get_rate(from_currency, to_currency)

  # Return the exchange rate
  return exchange_rate

# Define a function to connect to the currency exchange rate API
def connect_to_exchange_rate_api():
  # Code to connect to the API goes here
  pass


## The script defines three function: convert_currency(), get_exchange_rate(), and connect_to_exchange_rate_api(). Th convert_currency() function is the main function that you would use to convert one currency into another. It take three arguments: the amount of money you want to convert, the currency you want to convert from, and the currency you want to convert to. The get_exchange_rate() function is used to get the current exchange rate between the two currencies, and the connect_to_exchange_rate_api() function is used to connect to the currency exchange rate API that provides the exchange rates

## We can aswell attach the code below for the user interface
amount = 100
from_currency = "USD"
to_currency = "EUR"

converted_amount = convert_currency(amount, from_currency, to_currency)

# Print the converted amount
print(converted_amount)


# Hopefully that makes sense. Follow me on github at @AnthonyByansi
